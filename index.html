        <h1>Exposing Slyarch.</h1>
        <h4>On second thought - nevermind.</h4>
        <p>The truth about someone who has their description in their name.</p>

<a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hello.</h3>
<p>What you are about to see here may change your mind about Slyarch. For those of you who don't know who he is, he's a 'game developer' who was the leader for the project Pokémon Hierarchy. However, things took a bad turn, and the game ceased development.<br>But this posed a question. Why? Well, I'm about to explain it to you.</p>
        <h3>
<a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></a>Example 1: Attention Seeker.</h3>

<p>So I got my hands on this by accessing the Discord cache. Seems like he wants people who are famous to help him out in order to gain a huge following. How do I know that? Because from reading this person's session, they claim to be Go Ichinose, who is notorious for his work on the Pokémon games' soundtrack.<br><br>If you still don't believe that is real, look at this screenshot:</p>

<p>Thanks to Go who verified this in fact was true. Considering that he's gonna try to remove the conversation, it's best to keep it in a screenshot.</p>
        <h3>
<a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></a>Example 2: I'll just let you understand this one.</h3>

<p>Wow, he's so confident in keeping his personality under a good name, that he forces anyone to remove tweets that actually prove otherwise? Nice. Also I'm still not Ken so don't even start.<br><br>This even has to do with subpar creations...</p>

<p>Disappointing. You claim work you did isn't yours, just to get a good reputation? Pathetic.</p>
        <h3>
<a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></a>Example 3: Anonymous testimonial from some people who worked on one or more of his projects.</h3>
  <p>"I joined the team for Hierarchy expecting a team of people to come together, and make a game. But what I saw was everyone on the team doing work, except for Slyarch. He's a dick, and really dumb. I don't even think he's actually the age he claims to be, considering that he said he was around 23 - 26 without providing any evidence."<br><br>
    "I wish this guy learned. I try to help him out with development, but he only wants us to do it. What a lazy ass."<br><br>
    "He's a very decisive one indeed... all he wants to do is get famous people to notice him. Scumbag. Soon, he'll learn."</p><br><br><br>
