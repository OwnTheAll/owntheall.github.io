<p>What you are about to see here may change your mind about Slyarch. For those of you who don't know who he is, he's a 'game developer' who was the leader for the project Pokémon Hierarchy. However, things took a bad turn, and the game ceased development.<br>But this posed a question. Why? Well, I'm about to explain it to you.</p>

<p>So I got my hands on this by accessing the Discord cache. Seems like he wants people who are famous to help him out in order to gain a huge following. How do I know that? Because from reading this person's session, they claim to be Go Ichinose, who is notorious for his work on the Pokémon games' soundtrack.<br><br>If you still don't believe that is real, look at this screenshot:</p>

<p>Thanks to Go who verified this in fact was true. Considering that he's gonna try to remove the convo, it's best to keep it in a screenshot.</p>
